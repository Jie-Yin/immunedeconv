## Filing an issue

Bug reports and feature requests are indispensible for improving immunedeconv. To make them as useful as possible:

- Search the repository to see if someone has already reported the same issue.
  This allows contributors to spend less time responding to issues, and more time adding new features!
- Please provide a minimal complete verifiable example for any bug.

## Contributing code

We are absolutely enthusiastic about code contributions! If you prepare a PR, we'd like you to follow
the following guidelines:

### Tests

Please write tests! We use [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) to ensure the package works correctly.
You can refer to the [existing test suite](https://github.com/icbi-lab/immunedeconv/tree/master/tests)
and the [Testing chapter from the R packages book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html) when adding new tests.

### Documentation

When adding a new function, make sure you write appropriate documentation. We make use
of [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) to
document functions and [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) to render the documentation website.

- The roxygen2 docstring should describe what the function is doing (try to think about it from
  the prespective of the user).
- The docstring should describe all parameters and return values.
- Consider adding an example to one of the [vignettes](https://github.com/icbi-lab/immunedeconv/tree/master/vignettes).
