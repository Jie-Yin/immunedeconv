*Immunedeconv* ships with an example dataset with samples from four patients with metastatic melanoma published in [@EPIC2017]. 
It is available from `immunedeconv::dataset_racle`. It contains a gene expression matrix (`dataset_racle$expr_mat`) generated using bulk RNA-seq and 'gold standard' estimates of immune cell contents profiled with FACS (`dataset_racle$ref`). We are going to use the bulk RNA-seq data to run the deconvolution methods and will compare the results to the FACS data later on.   

The gene expression data is a matrix with HGNC symbols in rows and samples in columns:
The dataset is a matrix 
```{r}
# show the first 5 lines of the gene expression matrix
knitr::kable(dataset_racle$expr_mat[1:5, ])
```



To estimate immune cell fractions, we simply have to invoke the `deconvolute` function. It requires the specification
of one of the following methods for deconvolution:

```{r}
deconvolution_methods
```


For this example, we use `quanTIseq`. As a result, we obtain a cell_type x sample data frame with cell-type scores for each sample.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
res_quantiseq <- deconvolute(dataset_racle$expr_mat, "quantiseq", tumor = TRUE)
```


QuanTIseq generates scores that can be interpreted as a cell-type fraction. Let's visualize
the results as a stacked bar chart with tidyverse/ggplot2.
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
res_quantiseq %>%
  gather(sample, fraction, -cell_type) %>%
  # plot as stacked bar chart
  ggplot(aes(x = sample, y = fraction, fill = cell_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = rev(levels(res_quantiseq)))
```

We observe that

* the first two samples (LAU355, LAU1314) appear to contain a large amount of CD4+ T cells and B cells
* the last two samples (LAU1255, LAU125) appear to contain a large amount of "uncharacterized cells"
* the last sample (LAU125) appears to contain no CD8+ T cells, often associated with bad prognosis. 

Estimating the amount of "uncharacterized cells" is a novel feature introduced by quanTIseq and EPIC [@EPIC2017, @quantiseq2017]. This estimate often corresponds to the fraction of tumor cells in the sample. 


Let's now apply MCP-counter to the same dataset.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
res_mcp_counter <- deconvolute(dataset_racle$expr_mat, "mcp_counter")
```
MCP-counter provides scores in arbitrary units that are only comparable between samples, but not between
cell-types. The visualisation as bar-chart suggests the scores to be cell-type fractions and is, therefore, unsuitable.
Instead, we use ggplot to visualize the scores per-cell type, allowing for a relative comparison between samples.

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, warning=FALSE}
res_mcp_counter %>%
  gather(sample, score, -cell_type) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample, y = score, color = cell_type)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  facet_wrap(~cell_type, scales = "free_x", ncol = 3) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired", guide = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

With the scores being in arbitrary units, the results are not useful for judging if a cell type is present in the sample, or not. However, we can compare the relative values between samples and relate them to the results we obtained earlier using quanTIseq. 

* Consistent with quanTIseq, MCP-counter predicts B cells to be more abundant in LAU355 and LAU1314 than in the other two samples. 
* Also consistent with quanTIseq, the last LAU125 appears to contain significantly less CD8+ T cells than the other samples. 
* the estimates for Neutrophils and Monocytes are inconsistent with quanTIseq. 


## Comparison with FACS data
Let's now compare the results with 'gold standard' FACS data obtained for the four samples. This is, of course, not a representative benchmark, but it gives a notion about what magnitude of predictive accuracy we can expect. 
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# construct a single dataframe containing all data
#
# re-map the cell-types to common names.
# only include the cell-types that are measured using FACS
cell_types <- c("B cell", "T cell CD4+", "T cell CD8+", "NK cell")

tmp_quantiseq <- res_quantiseq %>%
  map_result_to_celltypes(cell_types, "quantiseq") %>%
  rownames_to_column("cell_type") %>%
  gather("sample", "estimate", -cell_type) %>%
  mutate(method = "quanTIseq")
tmp_mcp_counter <- res_mcp_counter %>%
  map_result_to_celltypes(cell_types, "mcp_counter") %>%
  rownames_to_column("cell_type") %>%
  gather("sample", "estimate", -cell_type) %>%
  mutate(method = "MCP-counter")

result <- bind_rows(tmp_quantiseq, tmp_mcp_counter) %>%
  inner_join(dataset_racle$ref)
```

Plot the true vs. estimated values: 
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=7, warning=FALSE}
result %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = true_fraction, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = cell_type, color = cell_type)) +
  facet_wrap(cell_type ~ method, scales = "free_y", ncol = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  theme_bw()
```

(MCP counter does not provide estimates for CD4+ T cells.)
